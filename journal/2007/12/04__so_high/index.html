<p>Here is the lyrics,</p>

<p><strong>So High - John Legend feat Lauryn Hill </strong></p>

<hr />
<pre>
It&#39;s nostalgic.
We gonna take this back with the cloud nine remix.

L-boogie, John Legend. Hey!

Feels like we can kiss the sky, baby, baby when we&#39;re high.
	Baby we&#39;re so high, yeah.
	Baby we&#39;re so high, yeah.

[Lauryn]
You&#39;re so conscious and self aware
I&#39;m next to you, I hold your back and you express pure ecstasy
It&#39;s more than just the sex to me
Because mentally you take me there ...

take me there, take me there, take me there

Yo, I pretended to be unaffected, You intended to be respected
I commend your boldness, you don&#39;t fear being rejected.
So you approached me my love and didn&#39;t remain intimidated.
Glad you did &#39;cause once you came you got much more than anticipated.

And its true, I&#39;ve got the mind of a genius.
And every time we kiss we feel the magnetic field we got between us.
I think its something to witness your vulnerability.
The definition of a real man, he can acknowledge how he feels for me.

And I&#39;m fascinated with your manhood exploration.
Your transparent language, how you articulate the situation.
And I can see it in your stare, in the air,
I love the texture of your hair, statuesque, black and beautiful like classical architecture.

[John]
Baby since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we are born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
And, you proved my fantasies what love could really be

Let&#39;s go to a place where only lovers go
To a spot that we&#39;ve never known
To the top of a cloud we&#39;re floating away

Ooh this feels so crazy, oh this love is blazing
Baby we are so high, walking on cloud nine

So high
So high
So high

[Both]
Feels like we can kiss the sky, baby baby we are so high...
Baby we&#39;re so high
Baby we&#39;re so high

[Lauryn]
Now maybe later we could go up to the moon
Or sail among the stars before the night is through
And when morning comes we&#39;ll see the sun is not so far
And we can&#39;t get much closer to God than where we are

So we&#39;ll go to a place where only lovers go
To a spot that we&#39;ve never known
To the top of the clouds we&#39;re floating way

Ooh this feels so crazy, oh this love is blazing
And baby we&#39;re so high, walking on cloud nine

So High (So high)
So High (So high)
So High (So high)

[John]
Feels like this love could be
All that its supposed to be

[Lauryn]
Feels just like exctasy
Each time you&#39;re holding me

[John]
All that we fantasize
We&#39;ve come to realize
Baby, baby, baby we can touch the sky

Feels like we can kiss the sky, baby baby when we&#39;re so high
Feels like we can kiss the sky, baby baby when we&#39;re so high
Feels like we can kiss the sky, baby baby when we&#39;re so high
