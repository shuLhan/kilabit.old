Nelly Furtado ft K&#39;naan - Going Away
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Nelly]
I saw you yesterday, your eyes all a-glazed, oh no.
Was it too much for you to take?
Did you want the pain to go away?

[K&#39;naan]
Yeah, I&#39;ll take it.

I knew I had to leave that trash on my sleeves;
Got caught up in the streets,
I couldn&#39;t really breath.
Oh, no (Oh, no)
So, then I took a gun,
Looked up into the sun,
The tears began to run,
Remembered when I was a little one (Oh, no)

That day, the mist in the morning
Made me feel like I was alone and
My soul in-a started swelling
Was it you, behind me, calling?
That day, the mist in the morning
Made me feel like I was alone and
My soul in-a started swelling
Was it you ...

[Together]
Are you going away? Are you going away?
Are you going away? Are you going away?

[Nelly] Remember?

[K&#39;naan] Remember there was that one summer you went away to school?
[Nelly ] My parents got a new job and I had to change schools.
[K&#39;naan] And there was that one time you went away to camp?
[Nelly ] Letters everyday until I got back.
[K&#39;naan] But, you said &#39;I&#39;ll keep in touch&#39; but my life got too rough.
[Nelly ] You were always so touched.
[K&#39;naan] Well, I guess I had enough.

[Nelly]
That day, in the misty morning
Was it you, behind me, calling?
Remember when we used to swing in the lawn and
sing that song &#39;till one of us would fall

[K&#39;naan] i remember ...

[Together]
Lalalalalalalala...
Are you going away? Are you going away?
Are you going away? Are you going away?
Are you going away? Are you going away?
Are you going away? Are you going away?
Are you going away? Are you going away?

I think I saw you on the bus today
I think I felt you in the wind today
I think I saw you in the street today
I think I felt you in the trees today
I think I felt you in the rain today
I think I saw you in the grocery store
I saw you in the back of the cab
I saw in the back of that cab

Anyways, guess I&#39;m going away.
Guess I&#39;m going away (Bye bye)
Guess I&#39;m going away.
Guess I&#39;m going away.
