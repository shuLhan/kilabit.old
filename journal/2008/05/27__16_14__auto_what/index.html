<h1>Auto...what?</h1>

<h2>Autoconf + Automake</h2>

<p>In my opinion Autoconf + Automake is bad, because:</p>

<ol>
	<li>I don&#39;t Like it.
	<p>Four years (maybe not long enough, but...) being a programmer in *nix environment, I never want to touch or event to read about &quot;What is Autoconf/Automake&quot;.</p>

	<p>OK, I&#39;m lie. I have read it several time, try to understand what it is, how to used it, but it just does not make sense to me, since I first know it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>It&#39;s become hard to maintain a source code.
	<p>Source program become large and large, just to make the program can run in other system. It&#39;s mean more &quot;if&quot;, &quot;ifndef&quot;. BAD. Even if the process to make the source-that-can-compile-in-your-system is handled automatically by Autoconf program it self, but programmer still need to create some configuration for Autoconf + Automake by hand.</p>

	<p>It is not a magnet.</p>

	<p>Remember that auto* itself is a program that could have a bug in it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Make a newbie hard to understand the flow of program. The only way to make a newbie can read the code is by &quot;make&quot; the source first.</li>
	<li>Complexity. Still in my opinion, Autoconf + Automake make it complex automatically.</li>
</ol>

<p>Why don&#39;t just separated the original source code, and then create another source directory for patch for different system?</p>

<p>In my stupid example:</p>

<pre>
original-source/
 a.c  # 1024 Lines
 b.c  # 512 Lines
 main.c  # 256 Lines
 Makefile # 128 Lines
patch/
 Linux-x86/ --&gt; Link to original-source
 sun-x86/
  a.c  # 512 (max) Lines
  b.c  # 256 (max) Lines
  main.c  # 128 (max) Lines
  Makefile # 64 (max) Lines
  patch.sh # 5-8 Lines
</pre>

<p>When user want to compile this source for sun-x86 they just go to &quot;patch/sun-x86&quot; directory, run the &quot;patch.sh&quot;, go back to original-source and then run &quot;make&quot; like usual.</p>

<p>Programmer who want to fix the program based on their system, just create another patch in their system patch directory without touching the &quot;original-source&quot;, and make original and another system maintainer happy.</p>

<p>A Newbie that want to fix a bug or want to contribute to the program can start from the &quot;original-source&quot;.</p>

<h2>About dependencies checking</h2>

<p>I am agree with a program that check dependencies of source code, before compiling, but not a program that change the source code just because some &quot;.h&quot; files is missing; or even worse, create a new source file.</p>

<h2>Today Solutions</h2>

<p>Actually, there is a solution to this multi-system-problem. They called &quot;Distributed Source Code Management&quot;, DSCM. One of the DSCM that we already know is &quot;git&quot;, have been used by Linux kernel developer. There is of course another DSCM like BitKeeper and mercurial, but &quot;git&quot; has been tested for a couple of year and heavily used.</p>

<p>With DSCM, we used this term now rather than point to the name of software directly, programmer can create several branch, quick and clean. This branch can be represented like,</p>

<pre>
	master (x86)
	sun-x86
	win-x86
</pre>

<p>&quot;sun-x86&quot; and &quot;win-x86&quot; is a branch of master. Any change to master can be push or pulled to another branch and with a little fix or changes. Just like that. win-win-win.</p>
