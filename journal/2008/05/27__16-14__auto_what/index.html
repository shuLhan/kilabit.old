<h1><a href='./index.html'>Auto...what?</a></h1>

<h2> Autoconf + Automake </h2>

<p>
In my opinion Autoconf + Automake is bad, because:
</p>

<ol>
<li> I don't Like it.
<p>
Four years (maybe not long enough, but...) being a programmer in *nix
environment, I never want to touch or event to read about "What is
Autoconf/Automake".
</p>
<p>
OK, I'm lie.  I have read it several time, try to understand what it is, how
to used it, but it just does not make sense to me, since I first know it.
</p>
</li>

<li> It's become hard to maintain a source code.
<p>
Source program become large and large, just to make the program can run in
other system. It's mean more "if", "ifndef". BAD. Even if the process to make
the source-that-can-compile-in-your-system is handled automatically by
Autoconf program it self, but programmer still need to create some
configuration for Autoconf + Automake by hand.
</p>
<p>
It is not a magnet.
</p>
<p>
Remember that auto* itself is a program that could have a bug in it.
</p>
</li>

<li>
Make a newbie hard to understand the flow of program. The only way to make
a newbie can read the code is by "make" the source first.
</li>

<li> Complexity. Still in my opinion, Autoconf + Automake make it complex
automatically. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Why don't just separated the original source code, and then create another
source directory for patch for different system?
</p>

<p>
In my stupid example:
</p>
<pre>original-source/
 a.c  # 1024 Lines
 b.c  # 512 Lines
 main.c  # 256 Lines
 Makefile # 128 Lines
patch/
 Linux-x86/ --&gt; Link to original-source
 sun-x86/
  a.c  # 512 (max) Lines
  b.c  # 256 (max) Lines
  main.c  # 128 (max) Lines
  Makefile # 64 (max) Lines
  patch.sh # 5-8 Lines
</pre>

<p>
When user want to compile this source for sun-x86 they just go to
"patch/sun-x86" directory, run the "patch.sh", go back to original-source and
then run "make" like usual.
</p>

<p>
Programmer who want to fix the program based on their system, just create
another patch in their system patch directory without touching the
"original-source", and make original and another system maintainer happy.
</p>

<p>
A Newbie that want to fix a bug or want to contribute to the program can
start from the "original-source".
</p>

<h2> About dependencies checking </h2>

<p>
I am agree with a program that check dependencies of source code, before
compiling, but not a program that change the source code just because some
".h" files is missing; or even worse, create a new source file.
</p>

<h2> Today Solutions </h2>

<p>
Actually, there is a solution to this multi-system-problem. They called
"Distributed Source Code Management", DSCM. One of the DSCM that we already
know is "git", have been used by Linux kernel developer. There is of course
another DSCM like BitKeeper and mercurial, but "git" has been tested for a
couple of year and heavily used.
</p>

<p>
With DSCM, we used this term now rather than point to the name of software
directly, programmer can create several branch, quick and clean. This branch
can be represented like,
</p>

<pre>
	master (x86)
	sun-x86
	win-x86
</pre>

<p>
"sun-x86" and "win-x86" is a branch of master. Any change to master can be
push or pulled to another branch and with a little fix or changes. Just like
that. win-win-win.
