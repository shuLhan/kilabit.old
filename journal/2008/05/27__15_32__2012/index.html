<p>Four years ago I got a lecture about operating system, and read a book about operating system, yes it was Tannenbaum book. Then I decided to write a kernel based on that book, and based on what the source code in that book.</p>

<p>A few days later, I heard about Linux, its sound silly but I heard them after some searching in Google about minix. It was an era where Google is just plain white html, with one form and one picture above the form.</p>

<p>And few months later I already forgot minix and start using SuSE in my box, g6t busy with homework and busy with others college task.</p>

<p>Four years later, minix 3 is out. I have graduated from college and still using SuSE. Then I read about minix 3 features again, and got a little surprised. &quot;Oh, my god! this is what I want, why it did take so long?&quot;. And I am thinking; thinking about Linux and the future, thinking about minix and what they can do to the future OS development.</p>

<p>A new era of a computer, where we do not got a blue screen anymore, no CTRL+ALT+DEL anymore, and even no &quot;reset&quot; button anymore. it was an idea about what Tannenbaum write in minix 3. It&#39;s cool, it&#39;s hot and it&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>There were just three mode: &quot;Logout&quot;, &quot;Refresh&quot;, and &quot;Suspend&quot;. &quot;Logout&quot;, when you want to get a sleep. &quot;Refresh&quot;, when you have fixing a bug in one of your module kernel for two night and need to try it loading in kernel. &quot;Suspend&quot;, when (it&#39;s rare for server but maybe just for personal use) you need to save your money from electric bill by suspending your computer. Can you HuRD me?</p>
