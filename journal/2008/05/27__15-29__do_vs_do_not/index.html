<h1><a href='./index.html'> Do vs. Do-not </a></h1>

<p>
This is a list of what I have learned from my experience in the past, and I
hope I do not make the same mistake in the future.
</p>

<p>
If you an Analyst,
<ul>
<li><b>Do</b> make a good documentation before development.</li>
	<ul>
	<li> A good documentation can make a fast development.</li>
	<li> A good documentation can make track every change while in
development.</li>
	<li> A good documentation can make a programmer know about a problem
with means they will know which algorithm or logic is the best that they will
applied to the problem.
	</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you a DBA,
<ul>
<li><b>Do not</b> change a field name in table occasionally.</li>
	<ul>
	<li> Changes in fields name impact to programmer time, and most
programmer does not like it.</li>
	<li> If you really need to change a field name, make a new field but
do not delete the old one, mark them as an absolute.</li>
	</ul>
<li> Trigger is fast but trigger can make you triggered in the late of the night after it.</li>
<li> Believe me with this one, Oracle suck! do not use it.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you are a Programmer,
<ul>
<li><b>Do read and learn</b>. Don't wasting others team with your stupid
question, what you must do is: Googling.</li>
<li> Read,</li>
<li> Read,</li>
<li> and Read!</li>
<li> Then ask your friend, if you cannot solve the problem.</li>
<li> Algorithm is cheap, time was expensive! Make or use a fastest algorithm
as possible!</li>
<li> Comment your code, please.</li>
</ul>
</p>
