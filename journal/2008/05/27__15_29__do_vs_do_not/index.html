<h1>Do vs. Do-not</h1>

<p>This is a list of what I have learned from my experience in the past, and I hope I do not make the same mistake in the future.</p>

<p>If you an Analyst,</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Do</strong> make a good documentation before development.

	<ul>
		<li>A good documentation can make a fast development.</li>
		<li>A good documentation can make track every change while in development.</li>
		<li>A good documentation can make a programmer know about a problem with means they will know which algorithm or logic is the best that they will applied to the problem.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If you a DBA,</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Do not</strong> change a field name in table occasionally.

	<ul>
		<li>Changes in fields name impact to programmer time, and most programmer does not like it.</li>
		<li>If you really need to change a field name, make a new field but do not delete the old one, mark them as an absolute.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Trigger is fast but trigger can make you triggered in the late of the night after it.</li>
	<li>Believe me with this one, Oracle suck! do not use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a Programmer,</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Do read and learn</strong>. Don&#39;t wasting others team with your stupid question, what you must do is: Googling.</li>
	<li>Read,</li>
	<li>Read,</li>
	<li>and Read!</li>
	<li>Then ask your friend, if you cannot solve the problem.</li>
	<li>Algorithm is cheap, time was expensive! Make or use a fastest algorithm as possible!</li>
	<li>Comment your code, please.</li>
</ul>
