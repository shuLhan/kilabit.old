<h1><a href='./index.html'> Pinky and The Brain </a></h1>

<p>
<em>
Last Friday, like usual in the middle of jum'at prayer, I am usually listening
to the khotib, but when the talk is rather boring, same content but different
package, I started to think a lot of things. Yes, a lot of things, usually
random thing. This time I am thinking about how the brain works.
</em>
</p>
<p>
So, lets talk about brain.
</p>

<p>
In my conscious time my brain think about how exactly the brain works. How
the brain works exactly? is it calculating or memorizing. This is what I am
thinking during that time.
</p>

<p>
Do you know what is the sum of 9 + 9? do you know after adding
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ... until 18 times or you just know that the sum is 18?
</p>

<p>
What about 9 * 9? what about 10000 * 9876?. The last two question is very
simple for the one who graduates from junior high school. Maybe.
</p>

<p>
What about 1234 * 4321? how many seconds do you need to answer that? It is
the same time when find the answer of 10000 * 9876? or not?
</p>

<p>
How do you find the answer for 1234 * 4321? This is one of the solution to
find the answer that I has been learned in school.
</p>

<pre>
      1234
      4321
   ------- *
      1234
     2468
    3702
   4936
   ------- +
   5332114
</pre>

<p>
We, human that has been in formal education, has been learned to remember basic thing
in school. The basic thing that can help us to solve the complex thing with
a little bit of work.
</p>

<p>
I know the result of 4 * 3, 1 * 4, 3 * 3, and 6 + 2 + 2 because I remember it.
But, I did not remember the result of 1234 * 4321. Why? because maybe I think
that is useless or I did not want to remember it, why would I?
</p>

<p>
And then, how about the "genius", where is it come from ?
</p>

<p>
I, for one, never and never will call some one a genius, smart, stupid or
moron; except for the purpose of a joke :).  I believe that every human has
the same brain, the different among peoples it just that some man do their
works with the brain more than the others, in others word: man that work out
their brain. I prefer to call some one genius with
the-man-with-more-experience-than-others and the stupid one with lazy.
</p>

<p>
Many of people call that Einstein is genius but I prefer to call him a human
that can memorize *more* than other people plus he has more experienced than
other in physics and math. Not because other people cannot memorize like him,
but some human brain have a standard of acceptable thing that they can
memorize. There is a many many reason for that, the simple reason and most
reasonable I can think right now is that some time our brain "reject"
what we see and what we learn. And why our brain do that, I don't know.
maybe it was like why we like food A but does not like food B.
</p>

<p>
After a couple of minute thinking and remembering, I come to conclusion that
our brain is _never_ do any calculating, but what its doing is memorizing.
How stupid of me, sorry, I mean is ... how lazy of me.
