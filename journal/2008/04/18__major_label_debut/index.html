Broken Social Scene - Major Label Debut
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I&#39;m just coming here to come down
I could be there, I could move town

Put my suits right on the guest list
Saw my passport, Became weightless

And I&#39;m all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up
And I&#39;m all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up

Draper Street caught me believing
Spill their eyes on all the ceilings

Forced to live like it&#39;s a curfew
Translation, it means I love you

And I&#39;m all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up
And I&#39;m all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up

I&#39;m just coming here to come down
I could be there, I could move town

Forced to live like it&#39;s a curfew
Translation, it means &quot;I love you&quot;

And I&#39;m all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up
And I&#39;m all hooked up
fucked up, i am all hooked up, fucked up
