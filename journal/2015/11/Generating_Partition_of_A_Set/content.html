<h1>Generating Partition of A Set</h1>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: given a set of discrete value {A,B,C} generate <em>k</em> partition of set where there is no empty partition and no duplicate value exist in subset of a partition.</p>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>No empty subset is returned.</li>
	<li>No duplicate value exist in each partitions, i.e. when partitioning into two subset, if subset one contain {A} and then the another subset must not contain {A}</li>
	<li>If <em>k</em> is 1 return the original set.</li>
	<li>If <em>k</em> is equal to number of value in set, return each element of set as a partition and as a subset.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>Given input set {A,B,C}, if <em>k</em> is 1 then the number of generated partition is 1 which is equal to original set: {A,B,C}. If <em>k</em> is 2 then the number of generated partition is 3 which consist of {{A},{BC}}, {{B},{C,D}}, and {{C},{A,B}}. If k is three then the number of generated partition is 3 which consist of {{A},{B},{C}}.</p>

<p>Another example, given input set {A,B,C,D}, if k is 1 then the number of generated partition is 1: {A,B,C,D}. If k is 2 then the number of generated partition is 7, which is {{A},{B,C,D}}, {{B},{A,C,D}}, {{C},{A,B,D}}, {{D},{A,B,C}}, {{A,B},{C,D}}, {{A,C},{B,D}}, {{A,D},{B,C}}. If k is 3 then the number of generated partition is 6, which is {{A},{B},{C,D}}, {{A},{C},{B,D}}, {{A}{D}{B,C}}, {{A,B},{C},{D}}, {{A,C},{B},{D}}, {{A,D},{B},{C}}. If k is 4 then the number of possible generated partition is 4: {{A},{B},{C},{D}}.</p>

<p>In mathematics, this problem is known as subproblem of combinatrics where the number of partition can be computed using &quot;Stirling number of the second way&quot; [1], which take <em>n</em> objects and the number of partition or <em>k</em>, and return number of possible partition of <em>n</em> using <em>k</em>. In computer science, the problem is called &quot;Partition of a set&quot;.</p>

<p>If you are a thinker and interested on solving this problem, go ahead, grab some paper and a pencil and close this journal.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

<p>Now, back to the problem. This is an old problem, oldest than computer it self. There are more papers out there which trying to be a fastest algorithm using iterative or parallel method (of course the last paper is the winner). Some of them using sequence of bit to mark wether a value is a group of partition. Here is the gist of it, given three value with two partition the possible sequence of bits are,</p>

<pre>
0 0 0 = 1 partition
0 0 1 = 2 partition
0 1 0 = 2 partition
0 1 1 = 2 partition
1 0 0 = 2 partition
1 0 1 = 2 partition
1 1 0 = 2 partition
1 1 1 = 3 partition
</pre>

<p>Can you see the pattern? The 0&#39;s bit is group one and 1&#39;s bit is another group. There are some problem with this solution: first, we must check for duplicate partition, i.e. 001 is duplicate with 110. Second problem, we must generate all bit for all values, for example partition with 3 subset is generated even if we only need 2 partitions.</p>

<p>There is another alternative without needed to check for duplicate and does not waste than k defined partition. The solution is using recursive function. Here is the algorithm,</p>

<p><strong>Function name:</strong> partition</p>

<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A: set of value</li>
	<li>k: number of partition</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<p>P: a set contain subsets of A into k possible partition without an empty set and duplicate value.</p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>

<p>(1) If k equal 1, then return A<br />
(2) if k equal to length of A, then<br />
(2.1) create new set A&#39;<br />
(2.2) for each value in A as <em>a</em><br />
(2.2.1) create new partition <em>p</em> contain only <em>a</em><br />
(2.2.2) add <em>p</em> to the new set A&#39;<br />
(2.2.3) return A&#39;<br />
(3) Create new set <em>B</em> for partitions<br />
(4) move the first elemen of A to <em>a1</em>, which make A contain n-1 element.<br />
(5) call function <em>partition</em> with parameter A and k, save the result to <em>A&#39;</em><br />
(6) for each partition in <em>A&#39;</em> as <em>p</em><br />
(6.1) for each subset in <em>p</em> as <em>sub</em><br />
(6.1.1) create new partition <em>p&#39;</em> by joining element <em>a1</em> with subset <em>sub</em> and add it to <em>B</em><br />
(7) call function <em>partition</em> with parameter A and k-1, save the result to <em>A&#39;&#39;</em><br />
(8) for each partition in <em>A&#39;&#39;</em> as p<br />
(8.1) create new partition <em>p&#39;</em> by appending element <em>a1</em> as subset to partition <em>p</em> and add it to B<br />
(9) return <em>B</em></p>

<p>Procedurally, if we give set {A,B,C} with 2 as partition number and call and print the algorithm, we will see the output like these,</p>

<pre>
partition({A,B,C},2)
  B:{}
  A: partition({B,C},2)
    B:{{B},{C}}
    return {B},{C}
  B:{{{B,A},{C}},{{B},{C,A}}
  A: partition({B,C},1)
    return {B,C}
  B:{{{B,A},{C}},{{B},{C,A}},{{B,C},{A}}
  return B</pre>

<p>Simple.</p>
