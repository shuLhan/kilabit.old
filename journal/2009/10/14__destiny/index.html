<p>
I can not remember the first
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivational_poster" target="_blank">
motivational poster
</a>
(or inspirational poster) that I saw, but my love to those posters is growing
up every time i see one (especially a
<a href="http://www.despair.com/viewall.html" target="_blank">
demotivational one
</a>
:). If you does not know what a (de)motivational poster was, i will give you
an example, here,

<p>
So, i am intrigue to create one, this one,
</p>

<p>
<img title="future motivational" src="./future_motivational.png"
	alt="Destiny" width="448" height="336" />
</p>

<p>
and this one,
</p>

<p>
<img title="future parody" src="./future_parody.png" alt="destiny"
	width="448" height="336" />
</p>

<p>
Now, let's talk about destiny; From
<a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/destiny" target="_blank">
Wikipedia Encyclopedia
</a>,
<blockquote>
Destiny refers to a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a
predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept
based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the
universe.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
If that definition was too <em>formal</em> for you, non-English speaker like
me, i will try to use a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_analogy" target="_blank">
<strong>car</strong> analogy
</a>
here to make it simple,
</p>
<blockquote>
Joe and Alice want to go from city A to city E. Alice goes to airport, 
unfortunately there is no airport in city E, the nearest airport is only at
city C. Alice bough a ticket to city C. At the airport in city C Alice meet
his old friend, they where talk a lots until the next morning, and later
Alice's mom called from home, say that her kitten just die, "go to home
now!". Alice go home and never going back to city C.
<br/>
<br/>
Joe know that no airport in city E, so he use a <strong>_car_</strong>. From
city A to city E, Joe need to go to city B first. Joe driving a car night and
day, unfortunately at some point in some unknown street he hit a cat. Joe
stop and try to save the cat, but the cat has already dead. Joe take the cat
body and knock every door in around neighbor looking for cat owners.
<br/>
<br/>
Joe meet Alice at Alice's house, and their live happily ever after.
</blockquote>

<p>
What happen if Joe never hit a cat ?  Joe and Alice meet each other at city
E, and their live happily ever after.
</p>

<p>
When Joe meet Alice at city E or at Alice's home, we can say that it's Joe
destiny to meet Alice, or vice-versa, but when Alice arrived at city C or
when Joe hit the cat we cannot say that it's Joe destiny to meet Alice
because it's never happen, yet.
</p>

<p>Do not take this story literally (I don't even use Car Analogy, i just put
a car word in some sentence, sorry),  person meet person, or person use a
car, but see it as a person who trying to achieve a goal. To meet with the
goal you can use different methods, different method can lead to a different
result, another method another result. Even if you cannot meet or never meet
the goal does not mean that you where fail, it's just that it is not your
destiny. My point here is, YOU CANNOT MOVE A PENCIL USING YOUR MIND!.
