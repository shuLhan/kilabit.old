<h1>Destiny</h1>

<p>No man knocks himself down; if his destiny knocks him down, his destiny must pick him up again.<br />
-- The Old Curiosity Shop by Dickens, Charles</p>

<p>I can not remember the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivational_poster" target="_blank"> motivational poster </a> (or inspirational poster) that I saw, but my love to those posters is growing up every time i see one (especially a <a href="http://www.despair.com/viewall.html" target="_blank"> demotivational one </a> :). If you does not know what a (de)motivational poster was, i will give you an example, here,</p>

<p>So, i am intrigue to create one, this one,</p>

<p><img alt="Destiny" src="./future_motivational.png" style="height:336px; width:448px" title="future motivational" /></p>

<p>and this one,</p>

<p><img alt="destiny" src="./future_parody.png" style="height:336px; width:448px" title="future parody" /></p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s talk about destiny; From <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/destiny" target="_blank"> Wikipedia Encyclopedia </a>,</p>

<blockquote>Destiny refers to a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the universe.</blockquote>

<p>If that definition was too <em>formal</em> for you, non-English speaker like me, i will try to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_analogy" target="_blank"> <strong>car</strong> analogy </a> here to make it simple,</p>

<blockquote>Joe and Alice want to go from city A to city E. Alice goes to airport, unfortunately there is no airport in city E, the nearest airport is only at city C. Alice bough a ticket to city C. At the airport in city C Alice meet his old friend, they where talk a lots until the next morning, and later Alice&#39;s mom called from home, say that her kitten just die, &quot;go to home now!&quot;. Alice go home and never going back to city C.<br />
<br />
Joe know that no airport in city E, so he use a <strong>_car_</strong>. From city A to city E, Joe need to go to city B first. Joe driving a car night and day, unfortunately at some point in some unknown street he hit a cat. Joe stop and try to save the cat, but the cat has already dead. Joe take the cat body and knock every door in around neighbor looking for cat owners.<br />
<br />
Joe meet Alice at Alice&#39;s house, and their live happily ever after.</blockquote>

<p>What happen if Joe never hit a cat ? Joe and Alice meet each other at city E, and their live happily ever after.</p>

<p>When Joe meet Alice at city E or at Alice&#39;s home, we can say that it&#39;s Joe destiny to meet Alice, or vice-versa, but when Alice arrived at city C or when Joe hit the cat we cannot say that it&#39;s Joe destiny to meet Alice because it&#39;s never happen, yet.</p>

<p>Do not take this story literally (I don&#39;t even use Car Analogy, i just put a car word in some sentence, sorry), person meet person, or person use a car, but see it as a person who trying to achieve a goal. To meet with the goal you can use different methods, different method can lead to a different result, another method another result. Even if you cannot meet or never meet the goal does not mean that you where fail, it&#39;s just that it is not your destiny. My point here is, YOU CANNOT MOVE A PENCIL USING YOUR MIND!.</p>
