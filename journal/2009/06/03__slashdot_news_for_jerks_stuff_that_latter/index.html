<h1>Slashdot: news for jerks, stuff that latter</h1>

<p>Nothing more to say, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=slashdot+sucks">Google already full of it</a>.</p>

<p>Here is my list of why,</p>

<ul>
	<li>The cripple UI.</li>
	<li>Stories that does not related to IT or &quot;Nerds&quot; anymore. if i want to read about politic or economy i will go to time.com you dikhed!</li>
	<li>Comment full of shit. The main thing that i like in old Slashdot time was their comments. They give you, at least, two sides of view that make you &quot;hmm&quot; and know others side of Nerds.</li>
</ul>

<p>For you who seek for an alternative see <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com"> Y </a>. But, seriously, the word Hacker is the <em>strong</em> word on the Internet. Using them for bunch of startup nerds community is not match from my opinion.</p>

<p>Welcome <a href="http://www.reddit.com" target="_blank" title="reddit">reddit</a>!</p>
