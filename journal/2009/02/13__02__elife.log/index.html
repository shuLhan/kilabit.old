Opera, the last two release (9.6x) is really buggy, must back to Firefox
2.0.0.18.
</p>

<p>
Since I am not using Opera anymore I try to use KMail, for my first
impression it seem OK but let time decided it. No, no Thunderbird for now.

<p>
Adblock Plus vs NoScript. Adblock Plus some time make browser "stack" / stop
at some point, but NoScript fast. Use NoScript!.

Last kernel update on openSuSE 10.3 make my laptop frequently hang, I cannot
find the cause, but it must be between one of these: kernel, ndiswrapper,
NVidia driver, ndiswrapper, or Opera. Yes, you Opera. Since I am already have
my own kernel-2.6.git, I try to use it. But, the last NVidia 180.22 not in
good shape, but NVidia look like have a quick respond and release 180.29 to
fix it.

With the latest kernel my kpowersave does not work, always 0% charged, or
could be my battery is broken.

The Beatles. My first The Beatles album was "1", and that was a great album,
giving the big picture of old music and the band to today generation, and
since then I thought The Beatles was a pop band (in my opinion Rock'n'Roll
was like a Pop version in '60), but after listening to several of their old
classic album like "Yellow Submarine", "Revolver" my thought change. This
band could not be a pop band, it must be some think like a rock but with...
hmmm, what is the word... roll, that's it.

<p>
And, the last one, my pet project has been launched
