<p>Opera, the last two release (9.6x) is really buggy, must back to Firefox 2.0.0.18.</p>

<p>Since I am not using Opera anymore I try to use KMail, for my first impression it seem OK but let time decided it. No, no Thunderbird for now.</p>

<p>Adblock Plus vs NoScript. Adblock Plus some time make browser &quot;stack&quot; / stop at some point, but NoScript fast. Use NoScript!.</p>

<p>Last kernel update on openSuSE 10.3 make my laptop frequently hang, I cannot find the cause, but it must be between one of these: kernel, ndiswrapper, NVidia driver, ndiswrapper, or Opera. Yes, you Opera. Since I am already have my own kernel-2.6.git, I try to use it. But, the last NVidia 180.22 not in good shape, but NVidia look like have a quick respond and release 180.29 to fix it.</p>

<p>With the latest kernel my kpowersave does not work, always 0% charged, or could be my battery is broken.</p>

<p>The Beatles. My first The Beatles album was &quot;1&quot;, and that was a great album, giving the big picture of old music and the band to today generation, and since then I thought The Beatles was a pop band (in my opinion Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll was like a Pop version in &#39;60), but after listening to several of their old classic album like &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot; my thought change. This band could not be a pop band, it must be some think like a rock but with... hmmm, what is the word... roll, that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>And, the last one, my pet project has been launched <a href="http://kilabit.info" target="_blank">www.kilabit.info</a>.</p>

<p>Good night, have a nice dreams, and must... watch those damn-to-many movie!</p>
