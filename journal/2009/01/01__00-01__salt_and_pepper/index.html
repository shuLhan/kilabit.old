<h1><a href='./index.html'> Salt and Pepper </a></h1>

<p>
Wondering how many account do we have today on the internet, from Yahoo to
Google, from MySpace to Friendster accounts. How do you manage all those
account password ? use one-for-all password ? like th15 or p455w0rd, or
your name ?
</p>

<p>
Some of us maybe like to use their name, child name, or birth date, because
it's memorize-able. That's ok, as long as you don't have any private or
credential information while communicating or browsing.
</p>

<p>
Some of us use what they call "OpenID". from user perspective, it easy and
manageable but from security view, no. The problem is it use one-for-all
password. Once your password is hacked, _all_ of your OpenID accounts is
"open" for attacker, not to mention any others

problem </a>.
</p>

<p>
Or maybe you use password like this 'ax23sd239dj1390sdm9323', every time you
want to log in to a web site you open your wallet, unfold a little white note
and read the password. :). That is good, really good. Now, if you cannot login
because of typo or the white note is missing, don't blame me.

On cryptography there is a concept called 'salt'. 'Salt' is added to the
'key'/'password' so the result is much yummy, sorry what I mean is, make it
not easy to break. But my point here is not about cryptography, but how do we
use a 'salt' concept in daily use on internet so we can have different
password for each account. Not even just on internet.
</p>

<p>
In example, we have an account on www.jackpot.com with user name: johndoe.
</p>

<p>
The trick is simple, really simple. Pick any combination of character to use
as a salt. Don't pick any meaning word (especially English word or your
mother language), pick a random one, like 'bhunjimko'. See, if you look at
your keyboard now those random character have their own pattern.
</p>

<p>
Now combine this salt with website name, and as option your user-name, result:
</p>

<pre>
bhunjimkojackpotjohndoe
</pre>

<p>
easy, eh ;). You can mix those three words in any pattern.
</p>

<p>
As easy as it sound, one salt is not good enough. You should use two salt, one
salt for character only and another salt for a number only. The most good one
is two salt with mix of character and number. Another example that I use,
</p>

<pre>
zxcvbnmyahoo1337
zxcvbnmgmail1337
mnbvcxzmyspace1337
mnbvcxzfs1337
</pre>

<p>
If I want to login to yahoo I just need to see to the keyboard, that's already
provided the 'salt' for me, and I just need to remember the four number.
Now, I just need to enter my login name... my login name... hmmm... damn it I
forgot my login name!
