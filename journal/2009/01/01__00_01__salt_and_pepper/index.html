<h1>Salt and Pepper</h1>

<p>Wondering how many account do we have today on the internet, from Yahoo to Google, from MySpace to Friendster accounts. How do you manage all those account password ? use one-for-all password ? like th15 or p455w0rd, or your name ?</p>

<p>Some of us maybe like to use their name, child name, or birth date, because it&#39;s memorize-able. That&#39;s ok, as long as you don&#39;t have any private or credential information while communicating or browsing.</p>

<p>Some of us use what they call &quot;OpenID&quot;. from user perspective, it easy and manageable but from security view, no. The problem is it use one-for-all password. Once your password is hacked, _all_ of your OpenID accounts is &quot;open&quot; for attacker, not to mention any others <a href="http://idcorner.org/2007/08/22/the-problems-with-openid"> problem </a>.</p>

<p>Or maybe you use password like this &#39;ax23sd239dj1390sdm9323&#39;, every time you want to log in to a web site you open your wallet, unfold a little white note and read the password. :). That is good, really good. Now, if you cannot login because of typo or the white note is missing, don&#39;t blame me.</p>

<p>On cryptography there is a concept called &#39;salt&#39;. &#39;Salt&#39; is added to the &#39;key&#39;/&#39;password&#39; so the result is much yummy, sorry what I mean is, make it not easy to break. But my point here is not about cryptography, but how do we use a &#39;salt&#39; concept in daily use on internet so we can have different password for each account. Not even just on internet.</p>

<p>In example, we have an account on www.jackpot.com with user name: johndoe.</p>

<p>The trick is simple, really simple. Pick any combination of character to use as a salt. Don&#39;t pick any meaning word (especially English word or your mother language), pick a random one, like &#39;bhunjimko&#39;. See, if you look at your keyboard now those random character have their own pattern.</p>

<p>Now combine this salt with website name, and as option your user-name, result:</p>

<pre>
bhunjimkojackpotjohndoe
</pre>

<p>easy, eh ;). You can mix those three words in any pattern.</p>

<p>As easy as it sound, one salt is not good enough. You should use two salt, one salt for character only and another salt for a number only. The most good one is two salt with mix of character and number. Another example that I use,</p>

<pre>
zxcvbnmyahoo1337
zxcvbnmgmail1337
mnbvcxzmyspace1337
mnbvcxzfs1337
</pre>

<p>If I want to login to yahoo I just need to see to the keyboard, that&#39;s already provided the &#39;salt&#39; for me, and I just need to remember the four number. Now, I just need to enter my login name... my login name... hmmm... damn it I forgot my login name!</p>
