<h1>This Society and Culture</h1>

<p>I try to not give a fuck about what or how I will live my life, but this society ... my society and my culture, give too much fuck about me. They judging me for who I am or I may become. They may talk behind me, I maybe not know. They may not talk behind me, I still wouldn&#39;t know. But, there is no way that you can&#39;t think about how people perceive you, how people ask and talk to you, when you different then anyone else.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>This society, my society ... give too much fuck about everyone else. Your parent, your families, your neighbors, or maybe some of your friends.</p>

<p>This society, my society ... there is no way that you can&#39;t give a fuck, unless you become numb. Unless you cut them from your life and disappear. Unless you pretend to being like them.</p>

<p>&quot;Freedom&quot;.</p>

<p>Every time I hear some one said that, some one from this society, my society ... my face smirking. Oh ... feels like punching them in the face.</p>
