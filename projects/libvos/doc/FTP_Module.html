 FTP Server Made Simple
=============================================================================

File Transfer Protocol is a mechanism to allow sharing of file from server
to any client through a network, shield a client from variations of file
system in server, and to transfer data reliably and efficiently.

Traditionally, FTP only served file system in host where it run, but
on today computing and technology, any hierarchical or tree like data can
be served using FTP.

FTP communication sometime use two channel or more, one for sending and
receiving FTP command and others channel for transmitting data. This two way
communication and with naked data transmission are disadvantages of FTP:
opening some random port in server and receiving or accepting any data based
only on the IP address of peer. With this security mindset you should know
when to use and when not to use FTP.

This article will try to explain how the simple FTP server could be
implemented.

* server-PI

  The server protocol interpreter "listens" on Port L for a connection
  from a user-PI and establishes a control communication connection.  It
  receives standard FTP commands from the user-PI, sends replies, and governs
  the server-DTP.

  In a normal and standard FTP server, server-PI listening on port 21.

* user-PI

  The user protocol interpreter initiates the control connection
  to the server-FTP process, initiates FTP commands, and governs the
  user-DTP if that process is part of the file transfer.

* server-DTP

  The data transfer port, in its normal "active" state. It sets up
  parameters for transfer and storage, and transfers data on command from its
  PI.

  After server-PI receiving PASV command, server will listening on any port
  greater than 1024, waiting for user-DTP.

* user-DTP

  The data transfer port establishes the data connection with server-DTP.
  If two servers are transferring data between them, the user-DTP is
  inactive.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 How the FTP Server works.
=============================================================================

* FTP server is used to host file system on network.

* FTP server listening on some port, the standard port is 21, waiting for
  client.

* FTP service can be authentication or can be anonymous mode.

	In authentication mode, FTP server should not use any system
	account for login. This is to minimize security break. FTP server can
	create a virtual account so other user/client from another host can
	login without exposing the real user name on the host system.

	Anonymous mode is when FTP server can allow any user to login just
	using 'anonymous' as user name and a format like email address for
	password.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 FTP Command
=============================================================================

* List of common FTP command.

	+ RFC 959

		- USER <SP> <username> <CRLF>
		- PASS <SP> <password> <CRLF>
		- SYST <CRLF>
		- TYPE <SP> <type-code> <CRLF>
		- MODE <SP> <mode-code> <CRLF>
		- STRU <SP> <structure-code> <CRLF>
		- CWD  <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>
		- CDUP <CRLF>
		- PASV <CRLF>
		- RETR <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>
		- STOR <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>
		- LIST [<SP> <pathname>] <CRLF>
		- NLST [<SP> <pathname>] <CRLF>
		- DELE <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>
		- RNFR <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>
		- RNTO <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>
		- RMD  <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>
		- MKD  <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>
		- PWD  <CRLF>
		- QUIT <CRLF>

	+ RFC 2389
		- FEAT <CRLF>

	+ RFC 3659

		- SIZE <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>
		- MDTM <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>


	LIST, NLST, RETR, and STOR is a command that must be done with PASV
	command. Those command need four process on client,

	- client send a PASV command to the server,
	- client connect to the server port based on PASV reply from server,
	- client send a specified command to the server,
	- client send/receive data transfer from DTP channel.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Common FTP Server Reply
=============================================================================

* 150	: Transfer begin.
* 200	: Command okay.
* 211	: List of server features.
* 213	: File status, reply of SIZE and MDTM command.
* 215	: Type of OS on the server.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 FTP Command Sequences
=============================================================================

* Client Connecting Process

	+ Command	: -
	+ Parameter	: -
	+ Server reply	:
		- 220	: Server banner.
	+ Description	:

	If the server banner more than one line, then first message must be
	using hyphen (or minus character) after the reply code, in example,

		220-first line
		second line
		 444 a line beginning with number.
		220 last line.

	Or, the most recommended one is every line that is not last line
	should be prefixed by a reply code + hyphen.

		220-first line
		220-second line
		220-444 a line beginning with number.
		220 last line

* Login Process

	+ Command	: USER
	+ Parameter	: user-name on FTP server.
	+ Server reply	:
		- 230	: success, user logged in, no need to send PASS.
		- 331	: success, continue with PASS command.
		- 530	: fail, unknown user.

	+ Command	: PASS
	+ Parameter	: string to identified user.
	+ Server reply	:
		- 230	: success, user logged in.
		- 503	: fail, bad sequence of command.
		- 530	: fail, invalid user or password.

* Querying FTP server OS name

	+ Command	: SYST
	+ Parameter	: -
	+ Server reply	:
		- 215	: success, format is,

				215<SP><OS name><CRLF> 

	+ Description	: ask for information about server's operating system.

		The recommended way of OS name according to [6] is,

			215 UNIX Type: L8

		or, but not recommended, an output of `uname -o` command.

		The SYSTem command is not mandatory, since it should not
		affect on how FTP server behave or how client pass the
		command to the server.

* Setting Transfer Mode

	+ Command	: TYPE
	+ Parameter	:
		- I	: for binary or Image transfer.
		- A	: ASCII.
		- E	: EBCDIC.
	+ Server reply	:
		- 200	: success.
	+ Description	:

		ASCII type was used to transfer text file, but since text
		file is a subset of binary file, FTP server can use binary
		type as default in any transfer.

		EBCDIC type is obsolete.

		In FTP-959 there is additional option after A and E, which
		is N (Non-print), T (Telnet format), and C (Carriage
		control). In FTPD all of those all ignored and considered
		obsolete.

		FTPD module only use the binary transfer, you cannot switch
		or turn it off to other type.


	+ Command	: MODE
	+ Parameter	:
		- S	: stream, data transmitted as a stream of bytes.
		- B	: block, data transmitted as a series of blocks.
		- C	: compressed.
	+ Server reply	:

		- 504	: fail, mode is rejected.
	+ Description	:

		MODE is obsolete, all data transfer must default to S [6].


	+ Command	: STRU
	+ Parameter	:
		- F	: File (no record structure)
		- R	: Record structure
		- P	: Page structure
	+ Server reply	:

			S>  MDTM
			S> 211 END

* Querying Size of File on Server [5]

	+ Command	: SIZE
	+ Parameter	: /path/to/file
	+ Server reply	:
		- 213	: success, format is,

				213<SP><size-of-file><CRLF>

		- 501	: fail, syntax error in parameter or arguments.
		- 550	: fail, path is not available, no access, etc.
	+ Description	:

		The FTP command, SIZE OF FILE (SIZE), is used to obtain the
		transfer size of a file from the server-FTP process.  This is
		the exact number of octets (8 bit bytes) that would be
		transmitted over the data connection should that file be
		transmitted.

		Example of FEAT response for SIZE,

			C> FEAT
			S> 211- <any descriptive text>
			S>  ...
			S>  SIZE
			S>  ...
			S> 211 END

* Querying Modification Time of File on Server [5]

	+ Command	: MDTM
	+ Parameter	: /path/to/file
	+ Server reply	:
		- 213	: success, format is,

				213<SP><time-value><CRLF>

		- 501	: fail, syntax error in parameter or arguments.
		- 550	: fail, path is not available, no access, etc.
	+ Description	:

		The FTP command, MODIFICATION TIME (MDTM), can be used to
		determine when a file in the server NVFS was last modified.

		Symbolically, a time-value may be viewed as

			YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.sss

		The "." and subsequent digits ("sss") are optional.  However
		the "." MUST NOT appear unless at least one following digit
		also appears.

		Time values are always represented in UTC (GMT), and in the
		Gregorian calendar regardless of what calendar may have been
		in use at the date and time indicated at the location of the
		server-PI.

	+ Parameter	: -
	+ Server reply	:
		- 227	: success, format is,

			227<SP>=<h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2><CRLF>

		- 451	: fail, local error in processing.

	+ Description	:

		This command request the FTP server to opening random port on
		server for data transfer.

		h1, h2, h3, and h4 is the IP4 address of server and p1, p2 is
		the port number ((p1 * 256) + p2)). Example, if server
		listening on, 192.168.1.1:5000 then

			p1 = 5000 / 256 = 19
			p2 = 5000 % 256 = 136

		and the reply message would become,

			227 =192,168,1,1,19,136

* Retrieving File from Remote to Local.

			C> opening data connection to 192.168.1.1:5000
			C> RETR /path/to/file
			S> 150
			S> server send data through DTP
			C> client retrieving data through DTP
			S> 226
			S> server close DTP
			C> check retrieved data size and server file size.

		Client will restart the transfer if file size if different.

* Storing Local File to Remote System.

	+ Command	: STOR
	+ Parameter	: pathname
	+ Server reply	:
		- 150	: success, transfer begin.
		- 226	: success, transfer end.
		- 425	: fail, server cannot open data connection to client.
		- 451	: fail, local error in processing.
		- 501	: fail, RETR without parameter.
	+ Description	:

		Sequence of commands,

			C> PASV
			S> 227 =192,168,1,1,19,136
			C> opening data connection to 192.168.1.1:5000

			C> client close DTP
			S> 226
			C> SIZE /path/to/file
			C> 213 size-of-file
			C> check retrieved data size and server file size.

		Client will restart the transfer if file size if different.

* Listing all files in the server

	There are two way of listing directory on server, LIST and NLST.

	LIST will use a long listing format. The format could be
	different between server.

	NLST will use a simple format, which is only send the name of file.

	Recommended format for LIST reply [6],

		-rw-r--r-- 1 owner group           213 Aug 26 16:31 README

	The line contains,

		+ '-' for a regular file or 'd' for a directory;
		+ the literal string 'rw-r--r-- 1 owner group' for a regular
		  file, or 'rwxr-xr-x 1 owner group' for a directory;
		+ the file size in decimal right-justified in a 13-byte
		  field;
		+ a three-letter month name, first letter capitalized;
		+ a day number right-justified in a 3-byte field;
		+ a space and a 2-digit hour number;
		+ a colon and a 2-digit minute number;
		+ a space and the abbreviated pathname of the file.

	File names containing spaces, stars, hyphens, or slashes will be
	misinterpreted by some clients, and must be omitted from the list. 

	The month name, day number, hour number, and minute number express the
	file's modification time in the server's local time zone. This creates
	several obstacles to reliable mirroring.

	The format shown above applies only to files modified in the last six
	months. Other files show the year instead of the hour number and
	minute number:

		-rw-r--r-- 1 owner group          1383 Apr 10  1997 ip.c

	Some servers (e.g., NetWare) set the cutoff at one year, making it
	impossible for the client to reliably distinguish dates near the
	cutoff from recent dates.

	+ Command	: LIST / NLST
	+ Parameter	:
		- none	: no parameter, then server will send list of
			  directory based on client CWD.
		- pathname
	+ Server reply	:
		- 150	: success, transfer begin.
		- 226	: success, transfer end.
		- 425	: fail, no DTP.
		- 450	: fail, pathname is not available or no access.

	+ Description	:

		Sequence of commands,

			C> PASV
			S> 227 =192,168,1,1,19,136
			C> opening data connection to 192.168.1.1:5000
			C> LIST /path/to/directory
			S> 150
			S> send data through DTP
			C> retrieving data through DTP
			C> close DTP
			S> 226

* Rename / moving file in the remote system

	Renaming or moving a file in remote system, consisting of two command
	operation. Beginning with RNFR and followed immediately by RNTO.

	* Command	: RNFR

	* Server reply	:
		- 350	: success, continue with RNTO.
		- 501	: fail, parameter is empty or invalid.
		- 550	: fail, invalid pathname.

	* Command	: RNTO
	* Parameter	: pathname

		C> RNFR /path/to/file
		S> 350
		C> RNTO /path/to/new-file-name
		S> 250

* Removing directory in the remote system
