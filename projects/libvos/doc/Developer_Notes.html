<h1> Developer Notes </h1>

<h2> From C to C-with-Class</h2>
<p>
After writing program long enough in C, I am started to developing some
pattern in my code. Most recognizable pattern is, in example,
</p>
<p>
<pre>
	func(struct adt* obj, int param)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
where <tt>struct adt</tt> is a collection of data that is dependable whether
it is mutual or not, and <tt>func</tt> is a function that change the content
of data in <tt>obj</tt>.
</p>
<p>
In C++ this pattern can be handled easily using <tt>class</tt> syntax, why
make it complicated if a compiler can handle it.
</p>
<p>
Unlike C, which is have a simple and minimalistic syntax, C++ offer a more
grammar to their user, on this library I only use three of them,
<ul>
<li><tt>class</tt>, including public and private section, </li>
<li><tt>namespace</tt>, and </li>
<li>class hierarchies : inheritance. </li>
</ul>
</p>
