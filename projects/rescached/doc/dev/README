 Record Format
==============================================================================

(This record is represented by NCR class.)


	rescached record format:

	+-------------------+
	| host-name         |
	+-------------------+
	| statistic         |
	+-------------------+
	| TTL               |
	+-------------------+
	| DNS answer packet |
	+-------------------+


- host-name

	host-name is the string that client queried to the rescached program.
	Example of host-name is: reddit.com, google.com, etc.

- record statistic

	Record statistic is a counter for record. This field track how many
	times the host-name has been queried by client.

- TTL (Time To Live), and

	TTL value, in second, is used to define how long the record will be
	keep on cache before it was renewed again.

- DNS answer packet

	This is a binary data, an answer packet from DNS parent server,
	contains query section and answer section.

rescached save all record in DSV format in file. Each field is separated by
pipe character ('|'). Example of rescached record on disk,

 How The Cache Works
==============================================================================

 Cache Tree
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Cache Tree is represented by NCR_Tree class.)


Cache Tree is used for searching. Cache Tree is saved in bucket-tree mode.

Each of the record is saved in bucket. rescached have 37 buckets, first
bucket is for a host-name that start with number zero (0) character, the last
bucket is for a host-name that start with any character except digit and
alphabet (the only character that allowed in host-name is underscore
, '_').


	rescached bucket visualized:

[0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|*]


Each of bucket is a root of a tree. rescached use a binary tree, and
normalized using Red-Black Tree algorithm.


	rescached tree node format:

	+--------+
	| color  |
	+--------+
	| record |
	+--------+
	| left   |
	+--------+
	| right  |
	+--------+
	| top    |
	+--------+
	| list   |
	+--------+

- color	: used for balancing tree in Red-Black Tree algorithm.
- record: pointer to rescached record object.
- left	: pointer to the left node in the tree.
- right	: pointer to the right node in the tree.
- top	: pointer to the top node in the tree.
- list	: pointer to list object in Cache List.


In example: if we have three DNS record started with 'A' character: a.com,
ab.com, and az.com, then the bucket and tree would be like:


	rescached tree:

      [...|A|...]
           |
        ab.com
        /    \
    a.com    az.com


 Cache List
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Cache List is represented by NCR_List class.)


The Cache List is a stack of all record ordered in ascending by the value of
statistic in each record. The top stack is the most queried host-name and the
bottom stack is the new or less queried host-name in the cache.


	rescached list format:

	+--------+
	| record |
	+--------+
	| up     |
	+--------+
	| down   |
	+--------+
	| last   |
	+--------+
	| tree   |
	+--------+

- record: pointer to rescached record object.
- up	: pointer to the above record in the stack.
- down	: pointer to the below record in the stack.
- last	: pointer to the last record in the stack.
- tree	: pointer to the record node in the tree (Cache Tree).


In example: if we have three DNS record with their statistic value started
with 'A' character: a.com (354), ab.com (572), and az.com (621), then the
stack would be like:

	+--------+ 
	| az.com |
	+--------+
	| ab.com |
	+--------+
	| a.com  |
	+--------+

Cache Tree and Cache List use the same record object.


 Maximum Cache and Threshold
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rescached has a maximum record that it can keep in memory. Threshold in
rescached is the minimum value, for statistic, to allow record to be keep in
the memory after the maximum cache is reached. Both of this value can be
set by user.

In example: Lets say we set rescached maximum cache is 5, and the threshold
value is 1. After some times the cache will grow and full.

	+------------------------+
	| host-name | statistic  |
	+------------------------+
	| az.com    | 10         |
	+------------------------+
	| ab.com    | 9          |
	+------------------------+
	| a.com     | 3          |
	+------------------------+
	| x.net     | 1          |
	+------------------------+
	| y.net     | 1          |
	+------------------------+

When the client queried another host-name, 'z.com', rescached will check if
current cache is reached its maximum value. Since the cache is full,
rescached will remove any record that have the statistic value less-equal
that the threshold value, and insert 'z.com' to the bottom of stack.

	+------------------------+
	| host-name | statistic  |
	+------------------------+
	| az.com    | 10         |
	+------------------------+
	| ab.com    | 9          |
	+------------------------+
	| a.com     | 3          |
	+------------------------+
	| z.com     | 1          |
	+------------------------+

If no record have a statistic value less-equal than threshold value,
rescached will increase threshold value by one and re-check the Cache
List until current cache size less than maximum cache.
