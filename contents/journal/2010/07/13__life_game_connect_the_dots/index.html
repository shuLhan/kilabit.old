<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
Red dot (X) is some thing that someone trust or want to believe to be true.
Green dot (Y) is the start point where someone will go to X using black dots.
Black dots is fact/rule/thing that will make X become true or believed. Your
task is to connect the Green dot to Red dot using black dot as a base point.

This article is not mean to be vague, is just that, first, it take
some point in your life until you realize it is not vague at all and you will
say "Oh"; second, it was not written for public actually, it just
some random thought that always flying in my head every nights that need to
be laid down so I can think about anything else and commit my memory in
this journal.

<p>
The picture is represent what I have been thinking over a few nights, about
how I, the green-dot (Y), perceive a red-dot (X) in my life.  Instead of
connecting the black dots by myself, my environment and culture where I live
and growing up already set that for me.  So, the line is already connected to
the X, I just need to believe that all the black dots is exist and the line is
true.  The problem is, not many people, even me, questioning those black-dots.
</p>

<p>
This pattern also can be applied to anything in life, except that black dot
represent something that we know (thing, place) or rule that has been set
before which become what we want to believe (X).
</p>

<p>
For example, some peoples on conspiracy theory, people that believe X was not
true, will always seek anything (black-dots) to prove that their were
right. They will search, make or do anything that can make a line from
green-dot to prove that X was not true or their opinion was right. Another
people that does not believe conspiracy theory can also search for any
black-dot (evidence) to disprove the theory or just accept the fact as what
it is.
</p>

<p>
The picture also what make me respect another person in life because between
me and others maybe we don't have the same connected dots.  But, the problem
is another person don't know about this.  They don't know that there is
another black dots beside their own connected dots.  The result of this will
be varies.
</p>

<p>
In case of knowledge: people that have more knowledge (black-dot) about X will
make it more knowledgeable from point of view of people that lack some of
knowledge.  Another side of this point of view is what we call people
ignorant. Here is a semi related video [1], by Robery Seyfarth about Theory
of Mind,
