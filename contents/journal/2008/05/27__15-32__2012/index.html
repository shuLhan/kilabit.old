<p>
Four years ago I got a lecture about operating system, and read a book about
operating system, yes it was Tannenbaum book. Then I decided to write a
kernel based on that book, and based on what the source code in that book.
</p>

<p>
A few days later, I heard about Linux, its sound silly but I heard them after
some searching in Google about minix. It was an era where Google is just
plain white html, with one form and one picture above the form.
</p>

<p>
And few months later I already forgot minix and start using SuSE in my box,
g6t busy with homework and busy with others college task.
</p>

<p>
Four years later, minix 3 is out. I have graduated from college and still
using SuSE. Then I read about minix 3 features again, and got a little
surprised. "Oh, my god!  this is what I want, why it did take so long?". And
I am thinking; thinking about Linux and the future, thinking about minix and
what they can do to the future OS development.
</p>

<p>
A new era of a computer, where we do not got a blue screen anymore, no
CTRL+ALT+DEL anymore, and even no "reset" button anymore. it was an idea
about what Tannenbaum write in minix 3. It's cool, it's hot and it's possible.
</p>

<p>
There were just three mode: "Logout", "Refresh", and "Suspend". "Logout",
when you want to get a sleep.  "Refresh", when you have fixing a bug in one
of your module kernel for two night and need to try it loading in kernel.
"Suspend", when (it's rare for server but maybe just for personal use) you
need to save your money from electric bill by suspending your computer. Can
you HuRD me?
